<header>
<h1>Hangin' at Motown</h1>
<img id="artistPic" src="">
<!-- There will be no image at the start of the game. Once the user wins or loses the first game, the image of the artist in the game results will appear.-->

<div id="recordSleeve">
	<p id="theArtist">Who's the artist? Need a hint?</p>
	<p id="gameBoard"></p>
	<button id="hint">Need a hint? Click Here!</button>
</div>

<!-- The record sleeve <div> will have a background image of the particular Motown/Motown subsidiary label of the answer to the puzzle. Within the circular label #theArtist should be positioned at the top/center of the circle, and the #gameBoard should be positioned in the bottom/center of the of the label - just as it would appear on a vinyl recording. Outside of the circular label will be all black.-->

<!--When user clicks on the button, the artist's name will appear at the top of the label -->

<!-- The background image may change with the puzzle. -->

<!-- The game will begin with just a snippet of "You Keep Me Hanging On", by Diana Ross and the Supremes-->


<div class="scoreboard">

	<p>Letters Already Guessed: <font id="wrong"></font></p>

<!-- The #scoreboard could be positioned within the #recordSleeve to look like a "buy me" sticker on an album in a record store. I'll use that exact "sticker" background, if I can google one. -->

<!-- At the start of a new game the "hangman.jpg" is just the platform/no body parts -->

<!-- When the user guesses wrong it will
	(1) subtrack 1 from the # of guesses remaining
	(2) It will update the hangman image accordingly
		# of Guesses Remaining: 5 = hangman-1.jpg = head
		# of Guesses Remaining: 4 = hangman-2.jpg = body
		# of Guesses Remaining: 3 = hangman-3.jpg = right/arm
		# of Guesses Remaining: 2 = hangman-4.jpg = left/arm
		# of Guesses Remaining: 1 = hangman-5.jpg = right/leg
		# of Guesses Remaining: 0 = hangman-6.jpg = left/leg (full body) -->

<!-- java script should add (+) the each letter guessed wrong to the #wrong ID, similar to how the Rock Paper Scissors video updated the wins/losses/ties count with one event updating the <p> tag as the score progressed -->

<!-- If the user repeats a wrong letter, nothing happens.-->
